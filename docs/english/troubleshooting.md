# Troubleshooting
- ## The Software is not starting
  - Is Java [installed](https://github.com/KarasuRou/LernSoftware/tree/master/docs/english/java_installing.md)?
  - Is Java 8 installed? Higher versions can lead to a nonfunctional software.

- ## If you need further help:
    Send the latest _.log_ file, which is contained in the logs directory (example: _stdout_day_month_year.log_) to GitHub as an issue, so I can help you.
